# OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING-USING-JAVA-
This repository contains lab assignments and projects for the "Object-Oriented Programming Using Java" course (MCA). It includes practical examples of core OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction, with organized folders, problem statements, and solutions for better learning.
